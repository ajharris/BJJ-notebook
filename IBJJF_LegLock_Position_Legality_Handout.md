# **IBJJF Leg Lock Across the Body – Position Legality (2024)**

This handout clarifies whether holding the opponent’s **right foot in your right armpit** (a leg lock across the body) constitutes **knee reaping** under the 2024 IBJJF Rules.  
It is designed for instructors to teach safe and rule-compliant application of leg locks in both gi and no-gi divisions.

## **IBJJF Rule Definition of Knee Reaping (2024)**

> “Knee reaping is characterized when one athlete places their thigh behind the opponent’s leg and passes their calf on top of the opponent’s body above the knee, placing the foot beyond the vertical midline of the opponent’s body and applying pressure on the opponent’s knee from the outside toward the inside, while keeping the foot of the leg at risk trapped between the hip and armpit.”

## **Described Position**

Opponent’s **right foot** is trapped in your **right armpit** — a *same-side* leg lock configuration.

- Your thigh is **not** behind the opponent’s leg.  
- Their foot does **not** cross their own midline.  
- There is **no inward (outside→inside)** pressure on the opponent’s knee.

## **Legality Assessment**

| Condition | Description | Legality |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Same-side control (right foot in right armpit)** | No thigh behind leg; foot stays on same side of opponent’s body. | ✅ Legal (Straight Foot Lock) |
| **Leg crosses opponent’s midline** | Foot or calf passes beyond centerline of opponent’s body. | ⚠️ Illegal (Serious Foul for White–Purple) |
| **Twisting inward torque on knee** | Outside→inside pressure causing knee rotation. | ❌ Illegal (Severe Foul – Disqualification) |

---

## **Explanation**

When the opponent’s right foot is in your right armpit, the leg remains on the **same side of their body** and does **not** meet the IBJJF definition of reaping.  
This position constitutes a **legal straight ankle lock** for divisions where that submission is permitted.  

It only becomes **knee reaping** if:
- Your attacking leg crosses over the opponent’s body, and  
- You drive the opponent’s knee inward, creating **outside→inside rotational force**.

## **Legality by Division**

| Division | Belts | Leg Across Body (Same-Side) | Leg Across Midline / Inward Torque |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Children (4–15)** | All | ❌ Not Allowed | ❌ Immediate DQ |
| **Juvenile (16–17)** | All | ❌ Not Allowed | ❌ Immediate DQ |
| **Adult White–Purple** | All | ✅ Legal if Straight Foot Lock | ⚠️ Serious/Severe Foul |
| **Adult Brown–Black** | Brown/Black | ✅ Legal if No Torque | ❌ Disqualification if Twisting |
| **Masters White–Purple** | All | ✅ Legal if Straight Foot Lock | ⚠️ Serious/Severe Foul |
| **Masters Brown–Black** | Brown/Black | ✅ Legal if No Torque | ❌ Disqualification if Twisting |

## **Instructor Notes**

1. For youth and lower-belt divisions, this position should be **avoided entirely** during live sparring.  
2. For advanced belts, ensure **no rotational pressure** is applied to the knee.  
3. Always train ankle locks by isolating pressure to the **foot and ankle**, not the knee.  
4. In competition, **immediately release** the position if the referee signals potential reaping.
